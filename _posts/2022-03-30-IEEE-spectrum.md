Our PNAS paper [_'The difÔ¨Åculty of computing stable and accurate neural networks: On the barriers of deep learning and Smale's 18th problem'_](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2107151119) has been picked up by [Charles Q. Choi](https://spectrum.ieee.org/u/charles-q-choi) who writes about it in this weeks [IEEE Spectrum](https://spectrum.ieee.org/deep-neural-network).
