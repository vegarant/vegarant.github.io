# Our paper "_On instabilities of deep learning in image reconstruction and the potential costs of AI_" has been published

Our paper _'On instabilities of deep learning in image reconstruction and the potential costs of AI'_ has been published in the [Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1907377117). 

It demonstrates that methods based on AI and deep learning can be unstable for image reconstruction.
