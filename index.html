<h2>Research interests </h2>
<p>
Broadly speaking, I'm interested in applied mathematics, with a particular focus on inverse problems and imaging. In particular, I am interested in methods for recovery of signals (vectors, images, or functions) from a limited set of measurements. The study of such methods uses tools from many areas of mathematics including <b>compressive sensing</b>, <b>approximation theory</b>, <b>mathematical signal processing</b> as well as <b>machine learning</b> techniques such as <b>deep learning</b>. During the last few years, methods based on learning have started to outperform many standard methods, not only in imaging, but in scientific computing in general. Yet, many of these new approaches seem to have a common Achilles heel: <i>stability</i>. Much of my research is focusing on stability and accuracy of methods for inverse problems.
</p>

<p>
More specifically I have been/am working on
</p>

<p>
<ul>
    <li> 
Stability of trained and non-trained neural networks for inverse problems related to imaging applications.  
    </li>  
    <li> 
Recovery guarantees and sampling strategies for signals with structured sparse representations in infinite-dimensional spaces. This is typically called infinite-dimensional compressive sensing.   
    </li>
    <li> 
Efficient computation of binary sampling and wavelet reconstruction for infinite-dimensional spaces. This also includes efficient computations of wavelet coefficients for wavelets on an interval. 
    </li>
    <li>
Stability (or lack thereof) for neural networks used for classification.
    </li>
</ul>
