<h1>Teaching</h1>

<h2>Courses</h2>
<p>
I've been involved in the teaching in the following courses
</p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/math/MAT-INF1100/index-eng.html">MAT-INF1100 – Modelling and computations</a></li>
<li> <a href="https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/math/MAT-IN1105/index-eng.html">MAT-INF 1100L / MAT-IN1105 – Programming, modelling and computations</a></li>
<li> <a href="https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/math/nedlagte-emner/MAT-INF2360/index-eng.html">MAT-INF2360 – Applications of linear algebra</a></li>
</ul> 
<p>
I first started working at a teaching assistant (TA) in the course MAT-INF 
1100 in 2012. Since then I've been a TA in this course and the courses MAT-INF 1100L / MAT-IN 1105 several times.  From 2016 to 2018 I have been giving the plenary lectures in MAT-INF 1100, solving the weekly exercise in front of the students. The autumn of 2019, I am lecturing MAT-INF 1100 together with Knut
Mørken.   
</p>

<p> MAT-INF 1100 and MAT-IN 1105 (previously MAT-INF 1100L) are first semester courses at the University
of Oslo with around 300 and 200 students, respectively. The two courses have separate teaching in the first half of the semester and joint
teaching the second half.  
</p>

<p>
The spring of 2017, I worked as a TA in the course MAT-INF 2360.
