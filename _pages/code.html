<h1>Code</h1>
<p>
This page contains an overview of the most noticeable code I have developed 
and which I believe others might have use for. If you are searching for code
related to a specific paper, you may consult my <a href="https://github.com/vegarant">Github</a> page.  
</p>
<h2>cslib</h2>
<p>
The <em>cslib</em> library is a large collection of scripts and functions
related to compressive sensing and image reconstruction tasks in general. It
has been developed in relation to the upcoming book <em>Compressive
imaging</em> by B. Adcock and A. C. Hansen, published by Cambridge University
Press. It is expected to be out in August 2021.

<h2>fastwht</h2>
<p>
The <em>fastwht</em> library is a very fast (CPU) implementation of the 
fast <em>Walsh-Hadamard</em> transform. At the computational core it uses the
<a href="https://www.jjj.de/fxt/">fxt library</a>. The library is 
interfaced with Matlab and Python, providing (1) a substantially faster implementation
of the <code>fwht</code> function in Matlab and (2) an implementation of the 
Walsh-Hadamard transform in Python. It also includes an interface for the 
sequency ordered Walsh function.

<h2>Continuous Walsh sampling and wavelet reconstruction</h2>
<p>
In many real world problems the samples one acquire comes from continuous
integral transforms, rather than discrete measurements. If one does not take
this into account when doing the reconstruction, it typically leads to noticeable
artifacts in the reconstructed signal. This code takes the infinite
dimensionality of continuous Walsh sampling and wavelet reconstruction into
account and computes a vector-matrix multiplication between a finite section of
the change of basis matrix in FFT-time. Note that this is not 
the same as a naive call <code>fwht</code> and <code>wavedec</code> functions 
in Matlab.

<h2>Applinalg</h2> 
Contributed to Ã˜yvind Ryan's wavelet library <em>applinalg</em>. 
This is a full blown wavelet library which, despite being written in pure 
Matlab and Python is almost comparable in speed with Matlabs own wavelet toolbox 
and PyWavelets. It is also the only library, (which I know of) which fully 
supports boundary adapted wavelets for both orthogonal and biorthogonal wavelets.

<h2>spgl1</h2>
<p>
<em>spgl1</em> is a wildly used optimization algorithm used for solving 
\[ \text{minimize}_{z \in \mathbb{C}^{N}} \| z\|_1 \quad\text{ subject to }\quad
\|Az - b\|_2 \leq \epsilon  \] 
This is a reimplementation of the <a href="https://github.com/mpf/spgl1">spgl1 algorithm</a> done in C++ rather than Matlab. 
It also includes a very slow implementation of a wavelet transform. This project 
was developed while writing my master thesis (2016), and have not been touched since.
